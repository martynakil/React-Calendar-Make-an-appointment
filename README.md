# React-Calendar-Make-an-appointment


My task was to create a form with validation.

This is where I practiced the state of react.

It was important in the task to:
- user fill in the form correctly, if not, the message was displayed that something is wrong
- data displayed under the form
- data had to be saved on local api



I used HTML, CSS, REACT and JSON SERVER
