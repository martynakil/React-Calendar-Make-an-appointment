<h1> Make an appointment! React Calendar </h1>

 
*<h2>Simple application  "add a note"* :blue_book:</h2>
>from the series: I'm learning React! :muscle:

----
*My task was to create a form that stores information about the meeting with a given person. The data is stored in the local API.*
*In this project, I studied components in React* * :blush:
-------

<h3>What did I use in the project? What have I learned?</h3>

* I practised components and compositions in React
* How to use fetch to get data
* How to use Json-server
* What is component life cycle
* what is state in react
* how to capture data from the form and add it to the API

-----
<h3>How to open a file? :eyes: </h3>

*On the right side you will find the "clone or download" button - click it.
* An item should appear with the "Download ZIP" option - click again.
* Now you just need to unpack the downloaded file and open it in your favorite editor.
* you must enter the appropriate folder (command "cd" + file name, e.g. cd excursionfile)
* you must to install all packages via npm install
* then you can start npm start


JSON SERVER

is installed in the project so you have to run it as well, otherwise the API will not work.
go to the root directory and type

----

json-server --watch ./db/data.json --port 3005



From now on, you can use the API at:

http: // localhost: 3005 / meeting
